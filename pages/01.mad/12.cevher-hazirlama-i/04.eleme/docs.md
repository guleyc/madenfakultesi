<p>The Einstein field equations (EFE) may be written in the form: \[ R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2} g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu} \] ... #### Sign convention The above form of the EFE is the standard established by _Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler_. The authors analyzed all conventions that exist and classified according to the following three signs (S1, S2, S3): $$ \begin{align} g_{\mu \nu} &amp; = [S1] \times \operatorname{diag}(-1,+1,+1,+1) \\[6pt] {R^\mu}_{\alpha \beta \gamma} &amp; = [S2] \times (\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha \gamma,\beta}-\Gamma^\mu_{\alpha \beta,\gamma}+\Gamma^\mu_{\sigma \beta}\Gamma^\sigma_{\gamma \alpha}-\Gamma^\mu_{\sigma \gamma}\Gamma^\sigma_{\beta \alpha}) \\[6pt] G_{\mu \nu} &amp; = [S3] \times {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu} \end{align} $$ The third sign above is related to the choice of convention for the Ricci tensor: $$ R_{\mu \nu}=[S2]\times [S3] \times {R^\alpha}_{\mu\alpha\nu} $$ ...</p>
