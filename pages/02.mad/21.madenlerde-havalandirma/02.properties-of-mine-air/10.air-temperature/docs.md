title: 'Air Temperature'
---

<p>Mine air temperatures are measured in SI units of Degrees Celsius. It is useful to recall that at normal sea level pressure, water freezes at 0&deg;C and boils at 100&deg;C.</p>
<p>The lowest (theoretically) possible temperature is &ndash;273.15&deg;C (sometimes known as &ldquo;absolute zero&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If we change the Celsius scale so that absolute zero (-273.15&deg;C) is reassigned the value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; then we will have what is known as the Kelvin temperature scale (K).</p>
<p>So 0 K = -273.15C&deg; and 273.15 K = 0&deg;C. In other words,</p>
<p>T(K) = T(&deg;C) + 273.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Equation 1 &ndash; Relationship Between &deg;C and K</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of air temperature readings that we deal with routinely in mining. They are dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Dry-bulb </strong>temperature is simply the air temperature. When measuring dry-bulb air temperatures it is important to avoid the effect of radiative heat transfer (i.e. temperature readings should not be taken near surfaces whose temperatures differ by more than several degrees form the air temperature &ndash; e.g. avoid measuring air temperature near a hot diesel engine)</p>
<p><strong>Wet-bulb </strong>temperature is measured with a thermometer whose bulb is covered with a thin, wet cotton sleeve. As with dry-bulb temperature readings, wet bulb air temperature measurement near surfaces whose temperatures differ by more than a few degrees from the dry-bulb air temperature, are avoided. The bulb must be aspirated by an airflow that is at least 3m/s, to ensure accurate reading. Due to the effect of evaporation, the wet bulb temperature will always be less than, or equal to the dry-bulb temperature.</p>
