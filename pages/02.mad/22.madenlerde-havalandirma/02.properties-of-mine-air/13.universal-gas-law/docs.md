title: 'Universal Gas Law'
---

<p>Charles&rsquo; law and Boyle&rsquo;s Law can be combined mathematically to produce what is known as the Universal Gas Law:</p>
<p>P1.V1/T1 = P2.V2/T2</p>
<p><strong>Equation 4 &ndash; Universal Gas Law</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, for a given quantity (mass) of a given gas, PV/T is a constant. The constant for one kilogram of a given gas is known as R, hence</p>
<p>R= P.V/T</p>
<p>Note that because we now specify that we have one kilogram of gas, then the volume (V) is in units of m3/kg &ndash; i.e. specific volume.</p>
<p>R varies depending on the gas type.</p>
<p>For dry air, R = 0.2871 kJ/kg, assuming pressure (P) is in kPa, temperature (T) is in K and specific volume (V) is in m3/kg). Note that a Joule is 1 N&sdot;m.</p>
