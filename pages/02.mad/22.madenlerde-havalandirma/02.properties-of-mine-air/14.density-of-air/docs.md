title: 'Density of Air'
---

<p>The density of dry air can be determined using the Universal Gas Law. An example calculation is outlined below:</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>What is the density of dry air at a barometric pressure of 95 kPa and a dry bulb temperature of 25&deg;C?</p>

<p><strong>This is a very useful &ldquo;first pass&rdquo; method to estimate the density of air. </strong>It is accurate to within &plusmn; 0.5% for any condition between dry air at any temperature and saturated air (100% relative humidity) up to 25&deg;C.</p>
<p>Another useful application of the Universal Gas Law is illustrated below:</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>200 m3/s of dry air at a temperature of 30&deg;C and barometric pressure of 95 kPa flows down an intake shaft into a mine. At the bottom of the shaft, the air temperature is measured as 37&deg;C and the barometric pressure is 102 kPa. What is the flow rate at the base of the shaft if there is no leakage and no moisture pick-up in the shaft?</p>

<p>The result shows that we have &ldquo;lost&rdquo; 9 m3/s (4&frac12;%) of our airflow before it reaches the base of the shaft.</p>
