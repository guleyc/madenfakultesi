title: 'Moisture in Mine Air'
---

<p>Up to now, we have assumed &ldquo;dry&rdquo; air for all of our calculations. This is a simplistic assumption since in mine airways, the air invariably also contains some water vapour.</p>
<p>The amount of water vapor contained in a volume of air is dependent on the temperature of the air. At higher temperatures, the amount of water vapor that the air can contain increases. When air contains the maximum possible amount of vapor at a given temperature, it is said to be <strong><em>saturated</em></strong>. Saturated air has a relative humidity of 100%.</p>
<p>If air containing a certain amount of water vapour is cooled, a temperature will be reached where the air is unable to contain all of the water vapour. The vapour will condense out into water droplets. This temperature is known as the <strong>dew point temperature</strong>.</p>
<p>Condensation of water vapour can cause &ldquo;fogging&rdquo; and can sometimes be a problem in mine airways where warm, humid air is cooled below its dew point (e.g. by a mine air cooler). Condensation of water sometimes also occurs in upcast ventilation shafts &ndash; in this case the cooling of the mine air is caused by the reduction in air pressure as the air travels upwards (the opposite of autocompression). The condensed water droplets can cause problems with surface fan operation.</p>
