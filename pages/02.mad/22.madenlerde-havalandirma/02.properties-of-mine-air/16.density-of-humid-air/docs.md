title: 'Density of Humid Air'
---

<p>The &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; density of dry air at 20&deg;C and 101,325 Pa barometric pressure is <strong>1.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the performance figures supplied with mine fans assume that the fans will operate at <strong>standard </strong>air density.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many mine fans operate in locations where the fan inlet air density is significantly different to standard air density. It is therefore necessary to understand how to calculate the actual air density against which the fans operate. In many situations, Equation 4 is sufficiently accurate, however where improved accuracy is important, it is necessary to employ a calculation method that takes into account the effect of the moisture contained within the mine air.</p>
<p>The density of air is the mass per unit volume and varies according to the water vapor contained in the air and three input values are required to determine the density of air which contains water vapor. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barometric Pressure</li>
<li>Dry Bulb Temperature</li>
<li>Wet Bulb Temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The air density can be calculated using the relationship described as</p>
