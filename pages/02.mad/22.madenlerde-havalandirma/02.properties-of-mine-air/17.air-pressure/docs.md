<p>To assist with understanding consider the following, when we pump up a tyre the pressure in the tyre becomes higher than the pressure of the atmosphere. Similarly, if we were to suck the air from a vessel (create a vacuum) the pressure of the air outside the vessel would be greater than the pressure of the air inside the vessel. When the tyre valve is opened the air flows from the tyre and if the vessel is opened the air will flow into the vessel. In both cases the air will <strong>flow from the high-pressure area to the low-pressure area </strong>until the pressure inside the vessel is the same as the pressure outside the vessel. When this happens the flow will stop.</p>
<p>This is also seen on a weather map where the wind blows from the HIGH pressure to the LOW pressure. The greater the pressure difference the faster the wind blows.</p>

<p>In ventilation (mines, buildings or otherwise) for air to flow from one point to another there must be a difference in pressure between the two points. This difference in pressure is known as the <strong>ventilating pressure </strong>and the following rules apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air will always flow from a high pressure point to a low pressure point and as long as this pressure is maintained, air will continue to flow,</li>
<li>The larger the pressure difference between these two points the greater the quantity of air will flow. This assumes the resistance between the two points remains unchanged.</li>
<li>Resistance to pressure reduces the ventilating pressure, ie the pressure is used up overcoming resistance to the airflow.</li>
<li>If the pressure difference between two points remains the same and the resistance to airflow between these points is increased the air quantity will decrease</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure is the force applied per unit area and in ventilating terms is usually expressed in Pascals.</p>
<p>One Pascal (Pa) = One Newton per square metre (N/m2)</p>
<p>There are may other expressions for pressure including inches of water gauge, millimetres of mercury all of which are required to be converted to Pascals for use in mine ventilation calculations. Of importance in to mine ventilation practitioners is the different types of pressure.</p>
