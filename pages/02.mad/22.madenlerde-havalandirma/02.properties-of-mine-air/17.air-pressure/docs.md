<p>To assist with understanding consider the following, when we pump up a tyre the pressure in the tyre becomes higher than the pressure of the atmosphere. Similarly, if we were to suck the air from a vessel (create a vacuum) the pressure of the air outside the vessel would be greater than the pressure of the air inside the vessel. When the tyre valve is opened the air flows from the tyre and if the vessel is opened the air will flow into the vessel. In both cases the air will <strong>flow from the high-pressure area to the low-pressure area </strong>until the pressure inside the vessel is the same as the pressure outside the vessel. When this happens the flow will stop.</p>
<p>This is also seen on a weather map where the wind blows from the HIGH pressure to the LOW pressure. The greater the pressure difference the faster the wind blows.</p>

<p>In ventilation (mines, buildings or otherwise) for air to flow from one point to another there must be a difference in pressure between the two points. This difference in pressure is known as the <strong>ventilating pressure </strong>and the following rules apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Air will always flow from a high pressure point to a low pressure point and as long as this pressure is maintained, air will continue to flow,</li>
<li>The larger the pressure difference between these two points the greater the quantity of air will flow. This assumes the resistance between the two points remains unchanged.</li>
<li>Resistance to pressure reduces the ventilating pressure, ie the pressure is used up overcoming resistance to the airflow.</li>
<li>If the pressure difference between two points remains the same and the resistance to airflow between these points is increased the air quantity will decrease</li>
</ul>
<p>Pressure is the force applied per unit area and in ventilating terms is usually expressed in Pascals.</p>
<p>One Pascal (Pa) = One Newton per square metre (N/m2)</p>
<p>There are may other expressions for pressure including inches of water gauge, millimetres of mercury all of which are required to be converted to Pascals for use in mine ventilation calculations. Of importance in to mine ventilation practitioners is the different types of pressure.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l8obfr0">Atmospheric Pressure</h4>
<p>The earth is contained in an atmosphere and by the force of gravity, it exerts a pressure on the surface of the earth caused by the weight of the air above.</p>
<p>Atmospheric pressure at sea level is equivalent to a mass of 10,000 kg on one</p>
<p>square meter (m2) of surface and is expressed in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Atmosphere,</li>
<li>013 Bar,</li>
<li>325 kPa,</li>
<li>1013 mb,</li>
</ul>
<p>The pressure shown on weather chats is usually expressed in millibars (mb) and often referred to as the Barometric Pressure.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l8obfr1">Barometric Pressure</h4>
<p>Barometric pressure is simply a description of the instrument used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere in which it is situated. In mine workings the pressure measured using a barometer includes pressure changes caused by fans and therefore is not always be a true indication of the atmospheric pressure outside the mine.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l8obfr2">Static Pressure (SP)</h4>
<p>Static pressure is the potential or stored energy of the air often called the &ldquo;bursting&rdquo; pressure and this term does in fact make it easier to visualise, because static pressure is the pressure exerted by the air on the walls of the containing vessel. For example when the tyre valve is opened the potential (static) pressure is then converted to kinetic energy as it flows from the tyre. In the case of a ventilation duct it is the pressure holding the duct open. It is called static pressure because it is the same as the pressure of the air, which would exist if the air were not moving.</p>

<p>In ventilation ducts the static pressure is measured with a side tube, normal to the direction of airflow.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l8obfr3">Velocity (Dynamic) Pressure (VP)</h4>
<p>Moving air possess &ldquo;kinetic energy&rdquo; which is the energy associated with motion. In mine ventilation this is termed &ldquo;Velocity Pressure&rdquo;. The faster the air moves the greater velocity pressure will be and vice versa. Velocity pressure cannot be measured directly; however, it can be measured indirectly using <strong>pitot tube.</strong></p>
<p>Velocity pressure is calculated from</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="air-pressure/2.png" alt="" width="108" height="65" />&nbsp; Equation 8 Velocity Pressure</strong></p>
<p>Where</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; VP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = Velocity Pressure (Pa)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rho;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = Density of air (kg/m3)<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; v&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = Velocity (m/s)</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l8obfr4">Total Pressure (TP)</h4>
<p>Total Pressure is the algebraic sum of the static pressure (potential energy) and the velocity pressure (kinetic energy) and is measured with a <strong>facing tube</strong>, parallel to the direction of flow.</p>
<p><img src="air-pressure/4.png" alt="" width="404" height="177" /></p>
<p>TP= SP + VP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Equation 3-9 Ventilating Pressure</strong></p>
<p>Where</p>
<p>TP = Total Pressure (Pa)<br /> SP = Static Pressure (Pa)<br /> VP = Velocity Pressure (Pa)</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l8obfr5">Measuring Pressure in a Duct</h4>
<p>The static, velocity and total pressure may be obtained for airflow in a duct using a tube and a manometer.</p>
