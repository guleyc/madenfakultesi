<p>Air is a mixture of a number gasses. Air is a perfectly mixed (homogeneous) mixture of gasses, in spite of the fact that the various component gasses have different densities.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Composition of Air</u></em></strong></p>
<p>Oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 20.93%<br /> Nitrogen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 78.11%<br /> Carbon Dioxide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0.03%<br /> Inert Gases&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0.93%<br /> Water Vapour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Variable</p>
<p>Mine air also contains a percentage of water vapour. The vapour is regarded as being a separate component or impurity (i.e. it is not viewed as being part of the air).</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l712r80">1. Air Temperature</h4>
<p>Mine air temperatures are measured in SI units of Degrees Celsius. It is useful to recall that at normal sea level pressure, water freezes at 0&deg;C and boils at 100&deg;C.</p>
<p>The lowest (theoretically) possible temperature is &ndash;273.15&deg;C (sometimes known as &ldquo;absolute zero&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If we change the Celsius scale so that absolute zero (-273.15&deg;C) is reassigned the value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; then we will have what is known as the Kelvin temperature scale (K).</p>
<p>So 0 K = -273.15C&deg; and 273.15 K = 0&deg;C. In other words,</p>
<p>T(K) = T(&deg;C) + 273.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Equation 1 &ndash; Relationship Between &deg;C and K</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of air temperature readings that we deal with routinely in mining. They are dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Dry-bulb </strong>temperature is simply the air temperature. When measuring dry-bulb air temperatures it is important to avoid the effect of radiative heat transfer (i.e. temperature readings should not be taken near surfaces whose temperatures differ by more than several degrees form the air temperature &ndash; e.g. avoid measuring air temperature near a hot diesel engine)</p>
<p><strong>Wet-bulb </strong>temperature is measured with a thermometer whose bulb is covered with a thin, wet cotton sleeve. As with dry-bulb temperature readings, wet bulb air temperature measurement near surfaces whose temperatures differ by more than a few degrees from the dry-bulb air temperature, are avoided. The bulb must be aspirated by an airflow that is at least 3m/s, to ensure accurate reading. Due to the effect of evaporation, the wet bulb temperature will always be less than, or equal to the dry-bulb temperature.</p>
<h4>2. Charles' Law</h4>
<p>Charles&rsquo; law states that the same rise of temperature produces in all gasses the same increase in volume, provided the pressure is kept constant.</p>
<p>In other words, at constant pressure:</p>
<p>T1/T2 = V1/V2</p>
<p><strong>Equation 2 &ndash; Charles&rsquo; Law</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T = Absolute temperature (K)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V = Volume occupied by gas</p>
<h4>3. Boyle's Law</h4>
<p>Boyle&rsquo;s law states that the volume occupied by a gas is inversely proportional to the absolute pressure exerted upon it, provided the temperature is kept constant. In other words if the pressure on the gases increases it&rsquo;s volume will decreases. Conversely if the pressure decreases, the volume of the gas will increase:</p>
<p>P1.V1 = P2.V2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Equation 3 &ndash; Boyle&rsquo;s Law</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P1 = Initial absolute pressure</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V1 = Initial volume occupied by gas</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P2 = Final absolute pressure</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V2 = Final volume occupied by gas</p>
<h4>4. Universal Gas Law</h4>
<p>Charles&rsquo; law and Boyle&rsquo;s Law can be combined mathematically to produce what is known as the Universal Gas Law:</p>
<p>P1.V1/T1 = P2.V2/T2</p>
<p><strong>Equation 4 &ndash; Universal Gas Law</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, for a given quantity (mass) of a given gas, PV/T is a constant. The constant for one kilogram of a given gas is known as R, hence</p>
<p>R= P.V/T</p>
<p>Note that because we now specify that we have one kilogram of gas, then the volume (V) is in units of m3/kg &ndash; i.e. specific volume.</p>
<p>R varies depending on the gas type.</p>
<p>For dry air, R = 0.2871 kJ/kg, assuming pressure (P) is in kPa, temperature (T) is in K and specific volume (V) is in m3/kg). Note that a Joule is 1 N&sdot;m.</p>
<h4>5. Density of Air</h4>
<p>The density of dry air can be determined using the Universal Gas Law. An example calculation is outlined below:</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>What is the density of dry air at a barometric pressure of 95 kPa and a dry bulb temperature of 25&deg;C?</p>
<p><img src="properties-of-mine-air/1.png" alt="" width="234" height="203" /></p>
<p><strong>This is a very useful &ldquo;first pass&rdquo; method to estimate the density of air. </strong>It is accurate to within &plusmn; 0.5% for any condition between dry air at any temperature and saturated air (100% relative humidity) up to 25&deg;C.</p>
<p>Another useful application of the Universal Gas Law is illustrated below:</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>200 m3/s of dry air at a temperature of 30&deg;C and barometric pressure of 95 kPa flows down an intake shaft into a mine. At the bottom of the shaft, the air temperature is measured as 37&deg;C and the barometric pressure is 102 kPa. What is the flow rate at the base of the shaft if there is no leakage and no moisture pick-up in the shaft?</p>
<p><strong><img src="properties-of-mine-air/2.png" alt="" width="195" height="160" /></strong></p>
<p>The result shows that we have &ldquo;lost&rdquo; 9 m3/s (4&frac12;%) of our airflow before it reaches the base of the shaft.</p>
<h4>6. Moisture in Mine Air</h4>
<p>Up to now, we have assumed &ldquo;dry&rdquo; air for all of our calculations. This is a simplistic assumption since in mine airways, the air invariably also contains some water vapour.</p>
<p>The amount of water vapor contained in a volume of air is dependent on the temperature of the air. At higher temperatures, the amount of water vapor that the air can contain increases. When air contains the maximum possible amount of vapor at a given temperature, it is said to be <strong><em>saturated</em></strong>. Saturated air has a relative humidity of 100%.</p>
<p>If air containing a certain amount of water vapour is cooled, a temperature will be reached where the air is unable to contain all of the water vapour. The vapour will condense out into water droplets. This temperature is known as the <strong>dew point temperature</strong>.</p>
<p>Condensation of water vapour can cause &ldquo;fogging&rdquo; and can sometimes be a problem in mine airways where warm, humid air is cooled below its dew point (e.g. by a mine air cooler). Condensation of water sometimes also occurs in upcast ventilation shafts &ndash; in this case the cooling of the mine air is caused by the reduction in air pressure as the air travels upwards (the opposite of autocompression). The condensed water droplets can cause problems with surface fan operation.</p>
<p><strong>7. Density of Humid Air</strong></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; density of dry air at 20&deg;C and 101,325 Pa barometric pressure is <strong>1.2 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</strong></p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the performance figures supplied with mine fans assume that the fans will operate at <strong>standard </strong>air density.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many mine fans operate in locations where the fan inlet air density is significantly different to standard air density. It is therefore necessary to understand how to calculate the actual air density against which the fans operate. In many situations, Equation 4 is sufficiently accurate, however where improved accuracy is important, it is necessary to employ a calculation method that takes into account the effect of the moisture contained within the mine air.</p>
<p>The density of air is the mass per unit volume and varies according to the water vapor contained in the air and three input values are required to determine the density of air which contains water vapor. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barometric Pressure</li>
<li>Dry Bulb Temperature</li>
<li>Wet Bulb Temperature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The air density can be calculated using the relationship described as</p>
<p><img src="properties-of-mine-air/3.png" alt="" width="384" height="59" /></p>
<p><strong>Equation 5 Density of Humid Air</strong></p>
<p>Where</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rho; = Air Density (kg/m3) (Some texts describe this as <em>vair </em>rather than air, this is to distinguish between dry air and air containing water vapour.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P = Atmospheric Pressure (kPa)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tw = Wet-bulb temperature(&deg;C)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; td = Dry-bulb temperature (&deg;C)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e = Partial Pressure of water vapour (kPa)</p>
<p><strong><img src="properties-of-mine-air/4.png" alt="" width="424" height="65" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Equation 6 Partial Pressure of Water Vapour</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="properties-of-mine-air/5.png" alt="" width="208" height="54" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Equation 7 Saturated Vapour Pressure at the Wet-bulb Temperature</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
<p>What is the density of the air in a drive where the wet and dry bulb temperatures are (respectively) 25 and 30&deg;C and the barometric pressure is 97.5 kPa.</p>
<p>We will solve this problem using both the approximate method (Equation 4) and the more accurate method (Equation 5).</p>
<p><strong>Approximate Method:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="properties-of-mine-air/6.png" alt="" width="292" height="169" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rearranging Equation 4&hellip;</p>
<p>In fact this is the density of dry air.</p>
<p><strong>More Accurate Method:</strong></p>
<p>Calculate the Saturated vapor pressure at the wet-bulb temperature</p>
<p><strong><img src="properties-of-mine-air/7.png" alt="" width="204" height="96" /></strong></p>
<p>Calculate the Partial Pressure of water Vapor</p>
<p><img src="properties-of-mine-air/8.png" alt="" width="524" height="95" /></p>
<p>Use Equation 5 to calculate the air density (&rho;):</p>
