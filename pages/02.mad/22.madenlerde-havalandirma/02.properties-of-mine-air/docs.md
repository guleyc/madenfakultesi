<p>Air is a mixture of a number gasses. Air is a perfectly mixed (homogeneous) mixture of gasses, in spite of the fact that the various component gasses have different densities.</p>
<p><strong><em><u>Composition of Air</u></em></strong></p>
<p>Oxygen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 20.93%<br /> Nitrogen&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 78.11%<br /> Carbon Dioxide&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0.03%<br /> Inert Gases&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0.93%<br /> Water Vapour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Variable</p>
<p>Mine air also contains a percentage of water vapour. The vapour is regarded as being a separate component or impurity (i.e. it is not viewed as being part of the air).</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l712r80">1. Air Temperature</h4>
<p>Mine air temperatures are measured in SI units of Degrees Celsius. It is useful to recall that at normal sea level pressure, water freezes at 0&deg;C and boils at 100&deg;C.</p>
<p>The lowest (theoretically) possible temperature is &ndash;273.15&deg;C (sometimes known as &ldquo;absolute zero&rdquo;).</p>
<p>If we change the Celsius scale so that absolute zero (-273.15&deg;C) is reassigned the value of &ldquo;0&rdquo; then we will have what is known as the Kelvin temperature scale (K).</p>
<p>So 0 K = -273.15C&deg; and 273.15 K = 0&deg;C. In other words,</p>
<p>T(K) = T(&deg;C) + 273.15 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Equation 1 &ndash; Relationship Between &deg;C and K</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of air temperature readings that we deal with routinely in mining. They are dry bulb and wet bulb temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>Dry-bulb </strong>temperature is simply the air temperature. When measuring dry-bulb air temperatures it is important to avoid the effect of radiative heat transfer (i.e. temperature readings should not be taken near surfaces whose temperatures differ by more than several degrees form the air temperature &ndash; e.g. avoid measuring air temperature near a hot diesel engine)</p>
<p><strong>Wet-bulb </strong>temperature is measured with a thermometer whose bulb is covered with a thin, wet cotton sleeve. As with dry-bulb temperature readings, wet bulb air temperature measurement near surfaces whose temperatures differ by more than a few degrees from the dry-bulb air temperature, are avoided. The bulb must be aspirated by an airflow that is at least 3m/s, to ensure accurate reading. Due to the effect of evaporation, the wet bulb temperature will always be less than, or equal to the dry-bulb temperature.</p>
<h4>2. Charles' Law</h4>
<p>Charles&rsquo; law states that the same rise of temperature produces in all gasses the same increase in volume, provided the pressure is kept constant.</p>
<p>In other words, at constant pressure:</p>
<p>T1/T2 = V1/V2</p>
<p><strong>Equation 2 &ndash; Charles&rsquo; Law</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T = Absolute temperature (K)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V = Volume occupied by gas</p>
<h4>3. Boyle's Law</h4>
<p>Boyle&rsquo;s law states that the volume occupied by a gas is inversely proportional to the absolute pressure exerted upon it, provided the temperature is kept constant. In other words if the pressure on the gases increases it&rsquo;s volume will decreases. Conversely if the pressure decreases, the volume of the gas will increase:</p>
<p>P1.V1 = P2.V2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Equation 3 &ndash; Boyle&rsquo;s Law</strong></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P1 = Initial absolute pressure</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V1 = Initial volume occupied by gas</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P2 = Final absolute pressure</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V2 = Final volume occupied by gas</p>
<h4>4. Universal Gas Law</h4>
<p>Charles&rsquo; law and Boyle&rsquo;s Law can be combined mathematically to produce what is known as the Universal Gas Law:</p>
<p>P1.V1/T1 = P2.V2/T2</p>
<p><strong>Equation 4 &ndash; Universal Gas Law</strong></p>
<p>Therefore, for a given quantity (mass) of a given gas, PV/T is a constant. The constant for one kilogram of a given gas is known as R, hence</p>
<p>R= P.V/T</p>
<p>Note that because we now specify that we have one kilogram of gas, then the volume (V) is in units of m3/kg &ndash; i.e. specific volume.</p>
<p>R varies depending on the gas type.</p>
<p>For dry air, R = 0.2871 kJ/kg, assuming pressure (P) is in kPa, temperature (T) is in K and specific volume (V) is in m3/kg). Note that a Joule is 1 N&sdot;m.</p>
<h4>5. Density of Air</h4>
<p>The density of dry air can be determined using the Universal Gas Law. An example calculation is outlined below:</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the density of dry air at a barometric pressure of 95 kPa and a dry bulb temperature of 25&deg;C?</p>
<p><strong>This is a very useful &ldquo;first pass&rdquo; method to estimate the density of air. </strong>It is accurate to within &plusmn; 0.5% for any condition between dry air at any temperature and saturated air (100% relative humidity) up to 25&deg;C.</p>
<p>Another useful application of the Universal Gas Law is illustrated below:</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>200 m3/s of dry air at a temperature of 30&deg;C and barometric pressure of 95 kPa flows down an intake shaft into a mine. At the bottom of the shaft, the air temperature is measured as 37&deg;C and the barometric pressure is 102 kPa. What is the flow rate at the base of the shaft if there is no leakage and no moisture pick-up in the shaft?</p>
<p>The result shows that we have &ldquo;lost&rdquo; 9 m3/s (4&frac12;%) of our airflow before it reaches the base of the shaft.</p>
