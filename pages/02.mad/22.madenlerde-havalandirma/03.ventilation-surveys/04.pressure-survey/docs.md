title: 'Pressure Survey'
---

<p>The primary purpose of conducting pressure surveys is to determine the frictional pressure drop ,p, that corresponds to the airflow, Q, measured in each branch of a survey route. There are essentially two methods. The more accurate is the gauge and tube or trailing hose method, in which the two end stations are connected by a length of pressure tubing and the frictional pressure drop measured directly. The second method, of which there are several variations, involves observing the absolute pressure on a barometer or altimeter at each station.</p>
<p>Although tradition within individual countries tends to favour one or other of the two methods, both have preferred fields of application. In general, where foot travel is relatively easy between measuring stations, the gauge and tube method can be employed. Where access is difficult as in multi-level workings or in shafts then the barometer method becomes more practicable.</p>
