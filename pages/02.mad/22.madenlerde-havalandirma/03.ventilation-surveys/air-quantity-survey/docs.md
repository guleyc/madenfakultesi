<p>The volume of air, Q, passing any fixed point in an airway or duct every second is normally determined as the product of the mean velocity of the air, V, and the cross-sectional area of the airway or duct, A</p>
<p><em>Q </em>= <em>V </em>&times; <em>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m<sup>3</sup>/s</em></p>
<p>Most of the techniques of observing airflow are, therefore, combinations of the methods available for measuring mean velocity and cross-sectional area.</p>
<p>There are a large variety of air velocity measuring instruments, however the following are most applicable to mining requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vane Anemometer</li>
<li>Hot Wire Anemometer</li>
<li>Velometer</li>
<li>Smoke Tube</li>
<li>Pitot-Static Tube</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l99drq0">Vane Anemometer</h4>
<p>The instrument consists simply of a light impeller that rotates at a speed dependent on flow rate. The impeller rotational speed is converted into an air velocity reading using either electronic or mechanical means. Most anemometers used in mine&nbsp; ventilation survey work are capable of measuring velocities in the range of 0.2 to 25 m/s, with an absolute accuracy of &plusmn; 0.5 m/s, or better. They are ideally suited to conducting primary ventilation surveys and for routine determination of air velocity.</p>

<p>Air velocities below 0.2 m/s should be measured with another technique such as a smoke tube or hot wire anemometer.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a reliable measure of the mean air velocity in an underground airway, it is important that a recommended technique of using the anemometer is employed.</p>
<p>The anemometer should be attached to a rod of at least 1.5 m in length, or greater for high airways. The attachment mechanism should permit the options of allowing the anemometer to hang vertically or to be fixed at a constant angle with respect to the rod. A rotating vane anemometer is fairly insensitive to yaw and will give results that do not vary by more than &plusmn;5 per cent for angles deviating by up to 30&deg; from the direction of the airstream. Hence, for most</p>
<p>underground airways, allowing the anemometer to hang freely at the end of the rod will give acceptable results. For airways of inclination greater than 30&deg;, the anemometer should be clamped in a fixed position relative to the rod and manipulated by turning the rod during the traverse such that the instrument remains aligned with the longitudinal axis of the airway.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l99drq1">Hot Wire Anemometer</h4>
<p>Hot wire anemometers are very useful for accurately measuring low air velocities (down to about 0.05 m/s). Before making a velocity measurement, it is important that the flow distribution and direction be checked first, using smoke tubes. Hot wire anemometers are generally not designed for use in the traversing measurement technique. They are suitable for taking spot measurements and most instruments have the facility to electronically average a number of spot readings. They are generally not directionally sensitive.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l99drq2">Velometer</h4>
<p>The velometer is a mechanical instrument that consists simply of a hinged vane that swings in a rectangular passage. A port in the side of the instrument casing is connected to the passage. When the instrument is held in an airstream, airflow through the port deflects the vane against spring pressure. The vane is connected directly to a velocity indication scale. Pitot type tubes can be attached to the port with hosing to enable velocity to be checked in ducts.</p>
<p>This instrument provides fast, accurate measurements of velocities down to about 0.2 m/s. It is well suited to routine work such as determining face velocities in secondary ventilation surveys. The velometer is directionally sensitive and can only be used for spot surveys. It must be read while being held by the observer and care must be taken to hold the instrument sufficiently far from the observer to avoid interference with the reading.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l99drq3">Smoke Tube</h4>
<p>A smoke tube consists of a glass tube (similar to a gas detector tube) that emits a highly visible smoke when air is aspirated through it via a rubber bulb. Smoke tubes give superior results to other less satisfactory improvised alternatives such as spray paint, a handful of fine dry dust or, cigarette smoke!</p>
<p>Measurements are taken by marking out a fixed distance in a drive with two paint lines on the roadway. The distance should be that which the smoke travels in about 30 seconds (the smoke cloud usually dissipates after this period of time). Smoke tubes are used for velocities of less than 0.1 m/s to 0.5 m/s and a measurement distance of about 5m is usually therefore appropriate. Smoke tubes can also be used to trace air leakage (e.g. into draw-points) and to help visualize the flow distribution.</p>
<h4 id="mcetoc_1c5l99drq4">Pitot-Static Tube&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Pitot-static tube (often referred to as the Pitot Tube) consists of two concentric "L&laquo; shaped tubes. A pitot static tube is used to determine pressure at a point. A variety of designs have been developed with advantages between the different designs generally applicable to research work. The pitot static tube can be used successfully without the need for corrections given if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The head is aligned to the direction of airflow within 15&deg; (2.5% error in the velocity).</li>
<li>The tube diameter must not exceed 1/25 the duct diameter in circular ducts and 1/20 the length of the smallest side in a rectangular duct.</li>
<li>The tube diameter should not exceed 15 mm.</li>
<li>The velocity should be between 3m/s and 70m/s.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pitot-static tube can be used to measure static, total and velocity pressure when connected to a manometer.</p>
