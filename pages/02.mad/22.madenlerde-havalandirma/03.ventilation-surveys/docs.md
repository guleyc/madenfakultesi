<p>A ventilation survey is an organized procedure of acquiring data that quantify the distributions of airflow, pressure and air quality throughout the main flowpaths of a ventilation system.</p>
<p>Measurements of airflow should be taken in all underground facilities at times and places that may be prescribed by law. Even in the absence of mandatory requirements, a prudent regard for safety indicates that sufficient routine measurements of airflow be taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>to ensure that all working places in the mine receive their required airflows in an efficient and effective manner,</li>
<li>that ventilation plans are kept up to date and</li>
<li>to verify that the directions, quantities and separate identity of airflows throughout the ventilation infrastructure, including escapeways, are maintained.</li>
</ol>
<p>Similarly, routine measurements of pressure differentials may be made across doors, stoppings or bulkheads to ensure they are also maintained within prescribed limits and in the correct direction.</p>
<p>A major objective of ventilation surveys is to obtain the frictional pressure drop, p, and the corresponding airflow, Q, for each of the main branches of the ventilation network. From these data, the following parameters may be calculated for the purposes of both planning and control:</p>
<ul>
<li>distribution of airflows, pressure drops and leakage</li>
<li>airpower (p x Q) losses and, hence, distribution of ventilation operating costs throughout the network</li>
<li>volumetric efficiency of the system</li>
<li>branch resistances</li>
<li>natural ventilating effects</li>
<li>friction factors</li>
</ul>
<p>While observations of airflow and pressure differentials are concerned with the distribution and magnitudes of air volume flow, other measurements may be taken either separately or as an integral part of a pressure/volume survey in order to indicate the quality of the air. These measurements may include wet and dry bulb temperatures, barometric pressures, dust levels and concentrations of gaseous pollutants.</p>
